<h1>Hi. I'm Dime.</h1>
I'm just some random person on github who just makes random things, like making websites, other coding projects, etc.
I'm not very active here, but I do usually update my website. So, yeah... That's all I guess. Oh, if your interested you can find my website projects here:
<br>
<br>
[RedIsle](https://dimesayakinam.github.io/RedIsle/)
<br>
> A website I made for personal use, I tend to update it alot.
<br>
<br>
[IsleOfMan](https://dimesayakinam.github.io/IsleOfMan/)
<br>
> A exploration/adventure type of website. Probably doesn't make much sense, but yeah.
